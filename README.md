# Business Site

The assignment was to create a business website with a hero header with image or video background. The website also should have a form.

I first made a simple design on paper. Then I added the menu and made it responsive with css (with I was unable to do this in the previous assignment and created two menus). Then I chose a video background. I placed a gradient overlay in the right colors over the video and some text.  It was quite difficult to get the video behind the menu and the text, I used z-index to achive this. I made a simple portfolio with grid columns. I actually wanted a gradient hover overlay but I didn't quite succeed. If I had more time I would have liked to do this. The form has a number of radio buttons and free text field. I added the bin.org and it seemed to work.
